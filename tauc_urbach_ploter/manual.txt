Program Instruction
CSV Files:

All CSV files should be in the same directory as the program.
The CSV file must have the same number of rows filled in every column.
The first row of the CSV file should contain the sample names, for example: sample1, empty cell, sample2, empty cell, etc.

Running the Program:

Open a terminal in the directory where the program is located.
Start Julia by typing julia in the terminal.
To run the program, type:
julia
include("tauc_urbach_ploter.jl")

Accessing the Plots:

To access the Tauc plot for a sample, type: tauc[n], where n is the sample number, e.g., tauc[1] for the first sample, tauc[2] for the second sample, and so on.
To access the Urbach plot for a sample, type: urbach[n], e.g., urbach[1] for the first sample, urbach[2] for the second sample, etc.
To view the sample names, type: namesD – this will show a Dictionary with corresponding numbers and sample names.
Configuration File:

In the config.txt file, you can edit the 
γ factor and the names of the files containing transmittance and refraction data.
The file names should be written in the format data_transmittance.csv and data_refraction.csv (with the .csv extension included).
Plot Interaction:

The plots have a slider that allows you to adjust the regression line.
Clicking the "Save" button will save the current zoom and everything visible on the plot at that moment.
You can zoom in and out on the plot by scrolling the mouse or dragging it with the right mouse button (RMB).
You can also zoom in by selecting an area on the plot: hold the left mouse button (LMB) and drag to create a selection box – the plot will zoom into that area.
To reset the plot view, double-click Ctrl + LMB.
To reset the slider, double-click Shift + LMB on the slider.
Updates:

Future updates to the program will be added.
